# Development Plan: rpl (fix-theming branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-05 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: waterfall*

## Goal
Refactor the theming system to eliminate conflicts between light/dark mode and terminal themes, ensure complete theme coverage across all components, and remove the complex central stylesheet (style.css) in favor of component-scoped theming.

## Requirements
### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current theming implementation
- [x] Document theming conflicts and issues
- [x] Define new theming architecture requirements
- [ ] Specify terminal theme variants and colors
- [ ] Define OS-based window styling requirements
- [ ] Identify all components requiring light/dark mode styling
- [ ] Define theme data structure and API
- [ ] Specify component-scoped styling approach
- [ ] Define settings migration strategy (theme names will change)

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed current theming system in style.css, App.vue, ConversationDisplay.vue, and SettingsPanel.vue
- [x] Clarified theming scope and architecture with user

## Complete

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] All theming functionality works correctly
- [ ] Theme switching works without conflicts
- [ ] All components are properly themed
- [ ] User acceptance criteria are met

### Tasks

## Key Decisions
### User Requirements Clarified:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Terminal themes apply ONLY to terminal content area
2. **App-wide Theming**: Rest of application uses light/dark mode system
3. **Terminal Theme Structure**: Fewer terminal themes, each with light and dark variants
4. **OS Integration**: Windows, settings, and context panels styled like native OS windows
5. **Complete Redesign**: No migration - fresh implementation

### New Architecture Requirements:
- **Dual Theme System**: 
  - App-level: Light/Dark mode for UI chrome (headers, settings, dialogs)
  - Terminal-level: Terminal themes (matrix, amber, etc.) with light/dark variants
- **OS-Aware Styling**: Window decorations and panels match OS conventions
- **Component Scoping**: Each component manages its own theme-aware styles
- **Eliminate Central CSS**: Remove style.css complexity, move to component-scoped styles

### Current Architecture Problems:
- App.vue manages both `isDarkMode` and `settings.theme` separately
- style.css contains both global variables and theme-specific overrides
- Components mix CSS custom properties from global scope with local styles
- Theme switching doesn't affect all UI elements consistently
