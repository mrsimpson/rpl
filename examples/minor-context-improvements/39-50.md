# Development Plan: rpl (minor-context-improvements branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-04 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Enhance HTTP context loading to support GitHub repositories by using Playwright to scrape repository pages, extract conversation files and context files while filtering out noise/irrelevant files.

## Explore
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Development plan created and workflow started

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze current HTTP loading implementation (FileSourceAdapter)
- [x] Examine existing GitHub integration (GistSourceAdapter) 
- [x] Understand current adapter selection logic in useConversationState
- [x] Research GitHub repository structure and file patterns
- [x] ~~Investigate Playwright integration for web scraping~~ **DECIDED: Use simple HTTP + HTML parsing**
- [x] Define conversation file detection patterns
- [x] Define context file detection patterns
- [x] Identify noise filtering requirements
- [x] **USER DECISION**: Avoid Playwright complexity, use fetch() + HTML parsing
- [x] **USER REQUIREMENTS**: No branch detection, JSON preferred, range patterns, reusable logic
- [x] **TEST REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/mrsimpson/rpl/tree/main/examples/feat-visualize-context
- [ ] Explore GitHub HTML structure using test repository
- [ ] Test HTML parsing approach with sample repository
- [ ] Define exact CSS selectors for file extraction
- [ ] Validate raw.githubusercontent.com URL conversion

### User Questions for Exploration:
1. **URL Patterns**: Which GitHub URL formats should we support? (repo root, specific branch, specific folder)
2. **Conversation Detection**: How to identify the main conversation file? (filename priority, size heuristics, user specification)
3. **Context Patterns**: Beyond range-based naming (1-5.md), support sequential (1.png, 2.png) or descriptive names?
4. **Test Repositories**: Any specific GitHub repos you want to test with?
5. **Noise Filtering**: Confirm which files to ignore (standard patterns, docs, config files)
6. **Performance Limits**: Repository size limits, file size limits, caching preferences?

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed current FileSourceAdapter (uses query parameter approach for context)
- [x] Examined GistSourceAdapter (API-based, supports context discovery)
- [x] Found adapter selection logic in useConversationState (URL pattern matching)
- [x] Explored project structure and example files
- [x] Found example context structure in examples/feat-visualize-context/
- [x] Identified range-based naming pattern (1-5.md, 20-30.png, conversation.json)

### Key Findings from Exploration:
- **Current HTTP Loading**: FileSourceAdapter uses query parameter approach (`?context=url-to-context-map`)
- **GitHub Gist Integration**: GistSourceAdapter uses GitHub API, discovers context files automatically
- **Adapter Selection**: URL pattern matching in useConversationState.ts (gist.github.com → GistSourceAdapter)
- **Example Structure**: feat-visualize-context folder shows conversation.json + context files with range naming
- **Range Naming**: Files like "1-5.md", "20-30.png" indicate message ranges for context
- **File Types**: Screenshots (PNG), markdown files, conversation JSON - typical GitHub repo content

## Key Decisions
### ✅ **FINAL USER REQUIREMENTS**
- **A. URL Support**: Simple GitHub URLs only, NO branch detection logic
- **B. Conversation File Priority**: JSON preferred over text files
- **C. Context Detection**: Range patterns (1-5.md, 20-30.png) + reusable logic
- **D. Test Repository**: `https://github.com/mrsimpson/rpl/tree/main/examples/feat-visualize-context`

### ✅ **DECIDED: Simple HTTP + HTML Parsing Approach**
- **Avoid Playwright**: Too complex, adds browser automation overhead
- **Use fetch() + HTML parsing**: GitHub's repository page structure is static and predictable
- **Trigger Pattern**: Detect GitHub repository URLs and use GitHubRepoSourceAdapter
- **URL Pattern**: `https://github.com/user/repo` triggers the new adapter

### GitHub Repository Context Loading Strategy:
1. **Target URL Pattern**: `https://github.com/user/repo` (simple URLs only)
2. **Simple HTTP Approach**: Fetch repository page HTML and parse file listings
3. **File Detection Patterns**:
   - **Conversation Files**: `conversation.json` > `conversation.txt` > `*.json` > `*.txt`
   - **Context Files**: Range-based naming like `1-5.md`, `20-30.png`, `4.jpg`, `7-8.mov`
   - **Supported Extensions**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.js`, `.css`, `.html`
4. **Noise Filtering**: Ignore common repo files like `README.md`, `package.json`, `.git*`, `node_modules/`, etc.
5. **Raw File Access**: Convert GitHub URLs to raw.githubusercontent.com for direct file access
6. **Reusable Logic**: Context detection logic should be reusable across adapters

## Notes
### GitHub Repository Structure Analysis:
- **Public Repos**: Can be scraped without authentication
- **File Listing**: Available through web interface scraping
- **Raw Access**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/branch/path/file`
- **Branch Support**: Default to `main` branch, support branch specification in URL
- **Folder Support**: Support deep folder structures for organized context files

### HTML Parsing Requirements:
- **DOM Parser**: Use browser's built-in DOMParser API
- **File Links**: Extract file links from repository file listing
- **File Types**: Identify file extensions and types
- **Error Handling**: Handle private repos, 404s, network errors
- **Performance**: Single HTTP request + parsing vs multiple API calls

### GitHub HTML Structure (to be explored):
- **File listing container**: Need to identify CSS selectors
- **File links**: Extract href attributes for file paths
- **File names**: Extract text content for file names
- **File types**: Identify directories vs files, file extensions

### Sample Repository for Testing:
- Could use the current project: `https://github.com/mrsimpson/rpl`
- Or any public repository with conversation-like files
- Need to examine HTML structure to identify parsing patterns
