I'd recommend not to trust the `responsible_vibe_mcp___proceed_to_phase`: In these moments, it's worth actually reviewing what your agent wants to do for you as this will be very determining to the implementation.

As we proceed, the agent gets a phase specific prompt what it shall do during implementation.
