# Scenario 9: Cross-Feature Integration

## Feature: GitHub Repository Loading Integration with Existing Features

**As a** user  
**I want** GitHub repository loading to work seamlessly with existing features  
**So that** all functionality remains available and no regressions occur  

---

## Background:
```gherkin
Given the GitHub repository loading feature has been implemented
And existing features were working before the implementation
```

---

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 9.1: Adapter Selection Logic
```gherkin
Scenario: System selects correct adapter based on URL patterns
  Given different URL types are entered:
    | url_type                    | url_example                                           | expected_adapter        |
    | github_repository           | https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main/path         | GitHubRepoSourceAdapter |
    | github_gist                 | https://gist.github.com/user/gist-id                | GistSourceAdapter       |
    | github_gist_raw             | https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/gist-id/raw | GistSourceAdapter       |
    | regular_file_url            | https://example.com/conversation.txt                 | FileSourceAdapter       |
    | local_file_url              | file:///path/to/conversation.txt                     | FileSourceAdapter       |
  When each URL is processed
  Then the correct adapter should be selected automatically
  And the adapter selection should be deterministic
  And no conflicts should occur between adapter selection rules
  And existing adapter functionality should remain unchanged
```

### Test Case 9.2: GitHub Gist Functionality (Regression Test)
```gherkin
Scenario: GitHub Gist loading continues to work after repository feature addition
  Given I enter a GitHub Gist URL: "https://gist.github.com/user/gist-id"
  When I click "Load Conversation"
  Then the GistSourceAdapter should be used
  And the gist should load using GitHub API as before
  And context discovery should work for gist files
  And all existing gist functionality should be preserved
  And no new bugs should be introduced to gist loading
```

### Test Case 9.3: File URL Loading (Regression Test)
```gherkin
Scenario: Regular file URL loading continues to work normally
  Given I enter a regular file URL: "https://example.com/conversation.txt"
  When I click "Load Conversation"
  Then the FileSourceAdapter should be used
  And the file should load using direct HTTP request
  And query parameter context discovery should work as before
  And all existing file loading functionality should be preserved
  And no performance regressions should occur
```

### Test Case 9.4: Local Folder Selection (Regression Test)
```gherkin
Scenario: Local folder selection feature continues to work
  Given I am on the home page
  When I click "Select Local Folder"
  Then the File System Access API should be triggered
  And folder selection dialog should appear
  When I select a folder containing conversation and context files
  Then the FileSystemContextAdapter should be used
  And local folder loading should work as before
  And context discovery should work for local files
  And no regressions should affect local folder functionality
```

### Test Case 9.5: File Upload Feature (Regression Test)
```gherkin
Scenario: File upload functionality remains unaffected
  Given I am on the home page
  When I click "Or upload a file directly"
  Then the file upload dialog should appear
  When I select a conversation file to upload
  Then the file should be processed using existing upload logic
  And conversation parsing should work as before
  And no GitHub-related code should interfere with file upload
  And upload performance should remain the same
```

### Test Case 9.6: Demo Loading (Regression Test)
```gherkin
Scenario: Demo conversation loading continues to work
  Given I am on the home page
  When I click "Load Demo"
  Then the demo conversation should load immediately
  And the demo should display in the terminal interface
  And all demo functionality should work as before
  And demo loading should not be affected by GitHub adapter changes
  And demo performance should remain consistent
```

### Test Case 9.7: Settings and Preferences Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: User settings work consistently across all loading methods
  Given I have configured specific settings:
    | setting_type        | setting_value    |
    | terminal_theme      | matrix           |
    | animation_speed     | fast             |
    | auto_play          | enabled          |
    | progress_indicator | visible          |
  When I load conversations from different sources:
    | source_type         | loading_method              |
    | github_repository   | GitHubRepoSourceAdapter     |
    | github_gist         | GistSourceAdapter           |
    | file_url           | FileSourceAdapter           |
    | local_folder       | FileSystemContextAdapter    |
  Then all settings should be applied consistently
  And theme changes should affect all conversation displays
  And preferences should persist across different loading methods
  And no settings should be lost or reset
```

### Test Case 9.8: Context Visualization Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Context visualization works consistently across all adapters
  Given conversations with context files are loaded from different sources:
    | source_type       | context_files_available |
    | github_repository | yes                     |
    | github_gist       | yes                     |
    | local_folder      | yes                     |
    | file_url          | yes (via query param)   |
  When context files are discovered and loaded
  Then the context panel should appear for all sources
  And context file rendering should be consistent
  And range-based context display should work uniformly
  And context prefetching should work for all adapter types
  And no adapter-specific context bugs should exist
```

### Test Case 9.9: URL Parameter Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: URL parameter loading works with new GitHub adapter
  Given direct URL navigation with parameters:
    | url_parameter                                                    | expected_behavior           |
    | ?url=https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main/path                | Load GitHub repository      |
    | ?url=https://gist.github.com/user/gist-id                      | Load GitHub gist            |
    | ?url=https://example.com/conversation.txt                       | Load file URL               |
  When I navigate directly to URLs with these parameters
  Then the appropriate adapter should be selected automatically
  And conversations should load without user interaction
  And error handling should work for invalid parameter URLs
  And existing URL parameter functionality should be preserved
```

### Test Case 9.10: Performance Impact Assessment
```gherkin
Scenario: New GitHub adapter doesn't negatively impact existing performance
  Given performance baselines for existing features:
    | feature_type      | baseline_load_time | baseline_memory_usage |
    | gist_loading      | 2 seconds         | 50MB                  |
    | file_loading      | 1 second          | 30MB                  |
    | local_folder      | 0.5 seconds       | 40MB                  |
    | demo_loading      | 0.2 seconds       | 25MB                  |
  When I test the same features after GitHub adapter implementation
  Then performance should meet or exceed baselines
  And no significant performance regressions should occur
  And memory usage should remain within acceptable ranges
  And new GitHub repository loading should have reasonable performance
```

### Test Case 9.11: Error Handling Consistency
```gherkin
Scenario: Error handling is consistent across all adapters
  Given similar error conditions occur across different adapters:
    | error_type        | github_repo_adapter | gist_adapter | file_adapter |
    | network_error     | handled gracefully  | handled      | handled      |
    | parsing_error     | handled gracefully  | handled      | handled      |
    | not_found_error   | handled gracefully  | handled      | handled      |
  When these errors occur
  Then error messages should be consistent in style and helpfulness
  And error recovery options should be similar across adapters
  And no adapter should have significantly worse error handling
  And users should have consistent error experiences
```

### Test Case 9.12: State Management Integration
```gherkin
Scenario: Application state management works correctly with all adapters
  Given the application manages state for:
    | state_component     | managed_data                    |
    | conversation_data   | messages, metadata, format     |
    | context_items       | discovered files, prefetched    |
    | loading_states      | progress, errors, completion    |
    | user_preferences    | settings, theme, playback       |
  When different adapters load conversations
  Then state should be managed consistently
  And state transitions should be clean between different loading methods
  And no state pollution should occur between adapter uses
  And state persistence should work uniformly
```

## Mock Data Requirements:
- **Multiple source types**: GitHub repos, gists, file URLs, local folders
- **Performance test data**: Conversations of various sizes for each adapter type
- **Error scenarios**: Network, parsing, and access errors for each adapter
- **Context file sets**: Context files accessible via different adapter types
- **Settings configurations**: Various user preference combinations
- **URL parameter examples**: Direct navigation URLs for each adapter type

## Expected Behaviors:
- All existing functionality continues to work without regression
- Adapter selection is automatic and correct based on URL patterns
- Performance remains acceptable across all loading methods
- Error handling is consistent and user-friendly across adapters
- Settings and preferences apply uniformly regardless of loading method
- Context visualization works consistently across all adapter types
- State management is clean and doesn't leak between different adapters
- URL parameter handling works correctly with new GitHub adapter
- No conflicts or interference between different adapter implementations
