# Scenario 5: Content Loading & Parsing

## Feature: Conversation and Context Content Loading

**As a** user  
**I want the** system to load and parse conversation and context file contents  
**So that** I can view and interact with the complete conversation data  

---

## Background:
```gherkin
Given the system has identified conversation and context files in a repository
And the files have valid download URLs from GitHub API
```

---

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 5.1: JSON Conversation Format Loading
```gherkin
Scenario: System loads and parses JSON conversation file
  Given the conversation file "conversation.json" has been identified
  And the file contains valid Q-Developer JSON format
  When the system loads the conversation content
  Then the JSON should be successfully parsed
  And the conversation format should be detected as "json-qdev"
  And the message count should be correctly identified
  And the conversation metadata should be extracted
  And the system should proceed to conversation display
```

### Test Case 5.2: Text Conversation Format Loading
```gherkin
Scenario: System loads and parses text conversation file
  Given the conversation file "conversation.txt" has been identified
  And the file contains valid shell-style text format
  When the system loads the conversation content
  Then the text should be successfully parsed
  And the conversation format should be detected as "text"
  And user/agent messages should be correctly identified
  And message boundaries should be properly detected
  And the system should proceed to conversation display
```

### Test Case 5.3: Large Conversation File Loading
```gherkin
Scenario: System loads a large conversation file
  Given the conversation file contains 1000+ messages
  And the file size is several megabytes
  When the system loads the conversation content
  Then a loading progress indicator should be displayed
  And the file should load within reasonable time limits
  And memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
  And the conversation should be fully accessible after loading
  And no performance degradation should occur
```

### Test Case 5.4: Corrupted Conversation File Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: System encounters corrupted conversation file
  Given the conversation file contains invalid JSON or malformed text
  When the system attempts to load the conversation content
  Then a parsing error should be caught gracefully
  And an error message "Unable to parse conversation file" should be displayed
  And the error should include helpful debugging information
  And the user should be redirected to home with clear error message
  And the application should not crash or become unresponsive
```

### Test Case 5.5: Context File Prefetching
```gherkin
Scenario: System prefetches context files in background
  Given context files have been discovered:
    | filename  | type     | priority |
    | 1-5.md    | document | 1        |
    | 20-30.png | image    | 20       |
    | 4.jpg     | image    | 4        |
  When the conversation loading begins
  Then context files should be queued for prefetching
  And prefetching should happen in background without blocking conversation
  And high-priority context files should be loaded first
  And prefetch progress should be logged appropriately
  And prefetched content should be cached for quick access
```

### Test Case 5.6: Context File Loading Errors
```gherkin
Scenario: Individual context files fail to load
  Given context files have been discovered and queued for loading
  And some context files return 404 or network errors
  When the system attempts to load context files
  Then individual file failures should not block conversation loading
  And failed context files should be logged with warnings
  And successfully loaded context files should remain available
  And the context panel should show only successfully loaded files
  And error handling should be graceful and non-blocking
```

### Test Case 5.7: Binary Context File Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: System loads binary context files (images, videos)
  Given context files include binary formats:
    | filename    | type  | format |
    | 1.png       | image | binary |
    | 2.jpg       | image | binary |
    | 3.mp4       | video | binary |
  When the system loads these context files
  Then binary files should be loaded as blob URLs
  And file metadata should be preserved
  And content should be ready for display in context panel
  And loading should not attempt text parsing on binary files
  And blob URLs should be properly managed for memory efficiency
```

### Test Case 5.8: Network Timeout Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: File loading encounters network timeouts
  Given conversation and context files have been identified
  And network conditions cause request timeouts
  When the system attempts to load file contents
  Then timeout errors should be handled gracefully
  And retry mechanisms should be available for critical files
  And partial loading should be supported where possible
  And users should receive clear feedback about network issues
  And the application should remain responsive during timeouts
```

### Test Case 5.9: Concurrent File Loading
```gherkin
Scenario: System loads multiple files concurrently
  Given multiple context files need to be loaded simultaneously
  When the system begins content loading process
  Then conversation file should have highest priority
  And context files should load concurrently where possible
  And loading should be throttled to avoid overwhelming the browser
  And progress should be tracked and reported appropriately
  And concurrent loading should not cause race conditions
```

### Test Case 5.10: Content Validation and Sanitization
```gherkin
Scenario: System validates loaded content for security
  Given conversation and context files have been loaded
  When the content is processed for display
  Then content should be validated for safety
  And potentially malicious content should be sanitized
  And HTML/script content should be handled securely
  And file types should match their declared extensions
  And content validation should not break legitimate content
```

## Mock Data Requirements:
- **Valid JSON conversation**: Well-formed Q-Developer JSON format
- **Valid text conversation**: Shell-style text format
- **Large conversation file**: 1000+ messages for performance testing
- **Corrupted files**: Invalid JSON, malformed text for error testing
- **Binary context files**: PNG, JPG, MP4 files for binary handling
- **Network error responses**: Timeout, 404, 500 errors for error handling
- **Mixed content types**: Text, binary, and edge case files

## Expected Behaviors:
- Content loading is efficient and provides user feedback
- Parsing errors are handled gracefully without crashing
- Binary and text files are handled appropriately
- Network issues don't block the entire loading process
- Security considerations are addressed in content handling
- Performance remains acceptable with large files
- Concurrent loading is managed effectively
