# Scenario 6: Conversation Display & Playback

## Feature: Conversation Display and Playback Controls

**As a** user  
**I want to** view and interact with the loaded conversation  
**So that** I can replay the conversation with proper controls and visual feedback  

---

## Background:
```gherkin
Given a GitHub repository conversation has been successfully loaded
And the conversation content has been parsed
And the system has navigated to the conversation view
```

---

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 6.1: Successful Conversation Display
```gherkin
Scenario: Loaded conversation is displayed in terminal interface
  Given a conversation with 155 messages has been loaded from GitHub
  When the conversation view is rendered
  Then the terminal interface should be displayed
  And the conversation title should show "Q-Developer Conversation"
  And the format indicator should show "json-qdev"
  And the message counter should display "0 / 155 messages"
  And the first user message should be visible with typewriter cursor
  And the terminal styling should match the selected theme
```

### Test Case 6.2: Format Detection Display
```gherkin
Scenario: System displays correct format information
  Given conversations of different formats are loaded:
    | format    | file_type | expected_display |
    | JSON      | .json     | json-qdev        |
    | Text      | .txt      | text             |
  When each conversation is displayed
  Then the format indicator should show the correct format
  And the parsing should match the detected format
  And the message structure should be appropriate for the format
```

### Test Case 6.3: Keyboard Controls Functionality
```gherkin
Scenario: User interacts with conversation using keyboard controls
  Given a conversation is displayed and ready for interaction
  When I press the "Enter" key
  Then the conversation should advance to the next message
  And the message counter should increment
  When I press the "Tab" key during typewriter animation
  Then the current message should complete immediately
  And the typewriter animation should skip to the end
  When I press the "Esc" key during auto-play
  Then auto-play should pause/resume
  And the play button should update to reflect the state
```

### Test Case 6.4: Typewriter Animation
```gherkin
Scenario: Messages display with typewriter animation
  Given a conversation is loaded and ready for playback
  When a message begins displaying
  Then text should appear character by character
  And a blinking cursor should be visible at the end
  And the animation speed should match user preferences
  And user messages should have different styling than agent messages
  When the message completes
  Then the cursor should remain visible until next action
```

### Test Case 6.5: Progress Tracking
```gherkin
Scenario: System tracks and displays conversation progress
  Given a conversation with multiple messages is loaded
  When I navigate through the conversation
  Then the progress counter should update accurately
  And the format should be "current / total messages"
  When I reach the end of the conversation
  Then the counter should show "155 / 155 messages"
  And appropriate end-of-conversation indicators should appear
```

### Test Case 6.6: Playback Controls
```gherkin
Scenario: User interacts with playback control buttons
  Given a conversation is displayed with playback controls visible
  When I click the "Play" button
  Then auto-play should begin
  And the button should change to "Pause"
  And messages should advance automatically
  When I click the "Pause" button during auto-play
  Then auto-play should stop
  And the button should change back to "Play"
  When I click the "Restart" button
  Then the conversation should return to the beginning
  And the message counter should reset to "0 / total"
  When I click the "Reset" button
  Then the conversation should reset completely
```

### Test Case 6.7: Message Type Indicators
```gherkin
Scenario: Different message types are visually distinguished
  Given a conversation contains different message types:
    | message_type | indicator | styling     |
    | user         | >         | user_style  |
    | agent        | <         | agent_style |
    | system       | $         | system_style|
  When messages are displayed
  Then each message type should have the correct indicator
  And the styling should match the message type
  And the visual distinction should be clear and consistent
```

### Test Case 6.8: Terminal Theme Application
```gherkin
Scenario: Conversation display respects selected terminal theme
  Given different terminal themes are available:
    | theme   | background | text_color | cursor_color |
    | matrix  | #000000    | #00ff00    | #00ff00      |
    | amber   | #1a0f00    | #ffb000    | #ffb000      |
    | blue    | #001122    | #00aaff    | #00aaff      |
  When a conversation is displayed with each theme
  Then the colors should match the theme specification
  And the terminal styling should be consistent
  And text should be readable with proper contrast
```

### Test Case 6.9: Large Conversation Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: System handles large conversations efficiently
  Given a conversation with 1000+ messages is loaded
  When the conversation is displayed and navigated
  Then the initial display should load quickly
  And navigation between messages should be responsive
  And memory usage should remain reasonable
  And the interface should not become sluggish
  And scrolling/navigation should remain smooth
```

### Test Case 6.10: Error State Display
```gherkin
Scenario: System displays appropriate error states
  Given various error conditions occur during conversation display:
    | error_type        | expected_display                    |
    | parsing_error     | "Unable to parse conversation"      |
    | loading_error     | "Error loading conversation"        |
    | network_error     | "Network connection issue"          |
  When each error occurs
  Then the appropriate error message should be displayed
  And the error should not crash the conversation view
  And users should be able to navigate back to home
  And error details should be logged appropriately
```

## Mock Data Requirements:
- **Complete conversation data**: JSON and text format conversations
- **Various message types**: User, agent, system messages
- **Large conversation**: 1000+ messages for performance testing
- **Different conversation lengths**: Short (10 messages) to long (1000+ messages)
- **Error scenarios**: Corrupted data, parsing failures
- **Theme configurations**: All available terminal themes

## Expected Behaviors:
- Conversation display is immediate and responsive
- Keyboard controls work consistently across all scenarios
- Typewriter animation is smooth and configurable
- Progress tracking is accurate and updates in real-time
- Playback controls function reliably
- Visual styling is consistent with selected themes
- Performance remains acceptable with large conversations
- Error states are handled gracefully with clear user feedback
