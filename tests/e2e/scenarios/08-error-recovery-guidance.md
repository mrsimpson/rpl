# Scenario 8: Error Recovery & User Guidance

## Feature: Error Handling and User Recovery

**As a** user  
**I want to** receive clear error messages and guidance when things go wrong  
**So that** I can understand what happened and know how to proceed  

---

## Background:
```gherkin
Given I am using the GitHub repository loading feature
And various error conditions may occur during the process
```

---

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 8.1: Clear Error Message Display
```gherkin
Scenario: System displays meaningful error messages for different failure types
  Given various error conditions occur:
    | error_type           | expected_message                                    | user_guidance                           |
    | private_repository   | "Repository is private or does not exist"          | "Try a public repository URL"           |
    | invalid_url          | "Invalid GitHub repository URL"                     | "Use format: github.com/user/repo/..."  |
    | network_error        | "Unable to access GitHub repository"                | "Check your internet connection"        |
    | no_conversation      | "No conversation file found in repository"          | "Ensure repository contains conversation files" |
    | api_rate_limit       | "GitHub API rate limit exceeded"                    | "Please try again later"                |
    | parsing_error        | "Unable to parse conversation file"                 | "Check file format and try again"      |
  When each error occurs
  Then the appropriate error message should be displayed prominently
  And helpful guidance should be provided to the user
  And technical jargon should be avoided in user-facing messages
```

### Test Case 8.2: Error State Navigation
```gherkin
Scenario: Users can navigate away from error states
  Given an error has occurred and is being displayed
  When the error message is shown
  Then a "Return to Home" option should be available
  And the option should be clearly visible and accessible
  When I click "Return to Home"
  Then I should be redirected to the home page
  And the source input field should be cleared or retain the previous value
  And I should be able to try a different URL
  And no error state should persist on the home page
```

### Test Case 8.3: Auto-redirect After Errors
```gherkin
Scenario: System automatically redirects after certain errors
  Given specific error types that warrant auto-redirect:
    | error_type         | redirect_delay | redirect_target |
    | private_repository | 3 seconds      | home page       |
    | no_conversation    | 3 seconds      | home page       |
    | parsing_error      | 3 seconds      | home page       |
  When these errors occur
  Then an error message should be displayed immediately
  And a countdown timer should show the redirect delay
  And the message should indicate "Redirecting to home in X seconds..."
  When the timer expires
  Then the user should be automatically redirected
  And the redirect should happen smoothly without jarring transitions
```

### Test Case 8.4: Retry Mechanisms
```gherkin
Scenario: Users can retry operations after recoverable errors
  Given recoverable errors occur:
    | error_type    | retry_option | expected_behavior              |
    | network_error | "Try Again"  | Retry the same operation       |
    | timeout       | "Retry"      | Retry with same parameters     |
    | api_error     | "Retry"      | Retry API call                 |
  When these errors are displayed
  Then a retry button should be available
  And the retry option should be clearly labeled
  When I click the retry button
  Then the original operation should be attempted again
  And loading states should be displayed during retry
  And if retry succeeds, normal flow should continue
  And if retry fails, error handling should repeat appropriately
```

### Test Case 8.5: Progressive Error Information
```gherkin
Scenario: System provides progressive disclosure of error information
  Given an error occurs with technical details available
  When the error is initially displayed
  Then a user-friendly message should be shown prominently
  And technical details should be hidden by default
  And an option to "Show Details" should be available
  When I click "Show Details"
  Then technical error information should be revealed
  And the technical details should include:
    | detail_type    | information                    |
    | error_code     | HTTP status codes, API errors  |
    | request_info   | URL, parameters attempted      |
    | timestamp      | When the error occurred        |
    | correlation_id | For debugging purposes         |
  And the details should be copyable for support purposes
```

### Test Case 8.6: Context-Aware Error Guidance
```gherkin
Scenario: Error messages provide context-specific guidance
  Given different stages of the loading process where errors can occur:
    | stage              | error_context                    | specific_guidance                           |
    | url_validation     | Invalid URL format               | "Use: https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch/path" |
    | repository_access  | Private or non-existent repo     | "Ensure repository is public and URL is correct"     |
    | file_discovery     | No conversation files found      | "Repository should contain conversation.json or .txt" |
    | content_loading    | File parsing failures            | "Check if conversation file is properly formatted"   |
  When errors occur at each stage
  Then guidance should be specific to what the user was trying to accomplish
  And suggestions should be actionable and clear
  And examples should be provided where helpful
```

### Test Case 8.7: Error Prevention and Validation
```gherkin
Scenario: System prevents errors through proactive validation
  Given users are entering GitHub repository URLs
  When I enter an invalid URL format
  Then real-time validation should provide immediate feedback
  And the "Load Conversation" button should remain disabled
  And helpful hints should guide toward correct format
  When I enter a correctly formatted URL
  Then validation should pass immediately
  And the button should become enabled
  And any previous error messages should clear
```

### Test Case 8.8: Graceful Degradation
```gherkin
Scenario: System degrades gracefully when partial failures occur
  Given a conversation loads successfully but some context files fail
  When context file loading encounters errors
  Then the conversation should still be displayed normally
  And successfully loaded context files should be available
  And failed context files should be noted but not block the experience
  And users should be informed about partial loading:
    | scenario                    | user_notification                                    |
    | some_context_files_failed   | "Some context files could not be loaded"            |
    | all_context_files_failed    | "Context files unavailable, showing conversation only" |
    | context_loading_slow        | "Context files are still loading in background"     |
```

### Test Case 8.9: Error Logging and Monitoring
```gherkin
Scenario: Errors are properly logged for debugging and monitoring
  Given various errors occur during GitHub repository loading
  When each error happens
  Then appropriate error information should be logged to console
  And logs should include sufficient context for debugging:
    | log_information | details                           |
    | error_type      | Classification of the error       |
    | user_action     | What the user was trying to do    |
    | request_details | URLs, parameters, timing          |
    | error_response  | API responses, status codes       |
    | user_agent      | Browser and environment info      |
  And sensitive information should not be logged
  And log levels should be appropriate (error, warn, info)
```

### Test Case 8.10: Error Recovery Flow Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Complete error recovery workflows function correctly
  Given I encounter an error during GitHub repository loading
  When I follow the error recovery process:
    | step | action                           | expected_result                    |
    | 1    | Error occurs and is displayed    | Clear error message shown          |
    | 2    | Click "Return to Home"           | Navigate back to home page         |
    | 3    | Enter corrected URL              | Validation passes, button enabled  |
    | 4    | Click "Load Conversation"        | Loading begins successfully        |
    | 5    | Successful load completes        | Conversation displays normally     |
  Then the complete recovery flow should work smoothly
  And no error states should persist between attempts
  And the user experience should feel natural and helpful
  And users should feel confident trying again after errors
```

## Mock Data Requirements:
- **Error response scenarios**: Various HTTP error codes and API failures
- **Invalid URL formats**: Different malformed GitHub URLs
- **Network failure simulations**: Timeout, connection refused, DNS failures
- **Corrupted file content**: Invalid JSON, malformed text files
- **Rate limiting responses**: GitHub API rate limit error responses
- **Partial failure scenarios**: Some files succeed, others fail
- **Recovery test data**: Valid URLs for successful retry attempts

## Expected Behaviors:
- Error messages are clear, helpful, and user-friendly
- Technical details are available but not overwhelming
- Recovery options are always provided where appropriate
- Auto-redirects happen smoothly with clear communication
- Retry mechanisms work reliably for recoverable errors
- Graceful degradation maintains core functionality
- Error logging provides sufficient debugging information
- Complete error recovery workflows are smooth and intuitive
- Users feel guided and supported when encountering errors
