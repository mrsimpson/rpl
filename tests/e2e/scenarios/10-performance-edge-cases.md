# Scenario 10: Performance & Edge Cases

## Feature: Performance and Scalability Testing

**As a** user  
**I want** the GitHub repository loading to perform well under various conditions  
**So that** the application remains responsive and reliable even with challenging scenarios  

---

## Background:
```gherkin
Given the GitHub repository loading feature is implemented
And various performance and edge case scenarios need to be tested
```

---

## Test Cases:

### Test Case 10.1: Large Repository Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: System efficiently handles repositories with many files
  Given a GitHub repository contains:
    | file_count | file_types                    | total_size |
    | 500+       | images, docs, code, misc      | 100MB+     |
  When I load the repository
  Then the file listing should be retrieved within reasonable time (< 5 seconds)
  And file filtering should complete efficiently (< 2 seconds)
  And memory usage should remain under 200MB
  And the browser should remain responsive during processing
  And only relevant files should be processed (noise filtering should be efficient)
```

### Test Case 10.2: Large Conversation File Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: System handles very large conversation files efficiently
  Given conversation files of various sizes:
    | file_size | message_count | format | expected_load_time |
    | 1MB       | 1000         | JSON   | < 3 seconds        |
    | 5MB       | 5000         | JSON   | < 10 seconds       |
    | 10MB      | 10000        | TEXT   | < 15 seconds       |
  When each conversation is loaded
  Then loading should complete within expected time limits
  And progress indicators should show loading status
  And the browser should not freeze or become unresponsive
  And memory usage should scale reasonably with file size
  And conversation display should be responsive after loading
```

### Test Case 10.3: Multiple Context Files Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: System efficiently handles many context files
  Given a repository with numerous context files:
    | context_file_count | file_types        | size_range    |
    | 100+              | images, docs      | 10KB - 2MB    |
  When context discovery and prefetching occurs
  Then context discovery should complete quickly (< 3 seconds)
  And prefetching should be throttled to avoid overwhelming the browser
  And high-priority context files should load first
  And context panel should remain responsive during loading
  And failed context file loads should not block successful ones
```

### Test Case 10.4: Network Condition Resilience
```gherkin
Scenario: System performs acceptably under various network conditions
  Given different network conditions:
    | network_type | bandwidth | latency | packet_loss |
    | fast         | 100Mbps   | 10ms    | 0%          |
    | slow         | 1Mbps     | 100ms   | 0%          |
    | unstable     | 10Mbps    | 50ms    | 2%          |
  When loading GitHub repositories under each condition
  Then the system should adapt gracefully to network speed
  And timeouts should be appropriate for the connection quality
  And retry mechanisms should handle intermittent failures
  And loading progress should be communicated clearly
  And the application should not crash due to network issues
```

### Test Case 10.5: Concurrent Loading Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: System handles concurrent loading requests appropriately
  Given multiple loading operations are triggered:
    | scenario_type           | concurrent_operations | expected_behavior        |
    | rapid_url_changes       | 5 quick URL changes   | Cancel previous requests |
    | multiple_context_files  | 20 context files      | Throttled loading        |
    | browser_tab_switching   | Multiple tabs         | Isolated loading states  |
  When these concurrent scenarios occur
  Then the system should handle concurrency gracefully
  And previous requests should be cancelled when new ones start
  And resource usage should be managed efficiently
  And no race conditions should cause application errors
  And the UI should remain responsive throughout
```

### Test Case 10.6: Memory Management
```gherkin
Scenario: System manages memory efficiently during extended use
  Given extended usage patterns:
    | usage_pattern              | operations_count | expected_memory_behavior |
    | load_many_conversations    | 20 conversations | Memory should not leak   |
    | load_large_context_files   | 50 large images  | Cleanup after use        |
    | rapid_navigation          | 100 navigations  | Stable memory usage      |
  When these usage patterns are executed
  Then memory usage should remain stable over time
  And garbage collection should reclaim unused memory
  And no significant memory leaks should occur
  And browser performance should not degrade over time
  And memory usage should return to baseline after operations
```

### Test Case 10.7: Browser Compatibility and Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: System performs consistently across different browsers
  Given different browser environments:
    | browser | version | platform | expected_performance |
    | Chrome  | latest  | macOS    | baseline            |
    | Firefox | latest  | macOS    | within 20% of baseline |
    | Safari  | latest  | macOS    | within 30% of baseline |
    | Edge    | latest  | Windows  | within 20% of baseline |
  When GitHub repository loading is tested in each browser
  Then performance should be consistent across browsers
  And all functionality should work in each environment
  And no browser-specific bugs should occur
  And memory usage should be reasonable in all browsers
```

### Test Case 10.8: Edge Case URL Handling
```gherkin
Scenario: System handles unusual but valid GitHub URLs
  Given edge case GitHub URLs:
    | url_type                    | url_example                                                    | expected_behavior |
    | very_long_path              | github.com/user/repo/tree/main/very/deep/nested/path/here    | Handle correctly  |
    | special_characters          | github.com/user/repo-name_test/tree/feature-branch/path      | Encode properly   |
    | unicode_characters          | github.com/user/repo/tree/main/测试/path                      | Handle UTF-8      |
    | maximum_length_url          | [URL at browser limit ~2000 chars]                           | Handle or reject  |
  When these URLs are processed
  Then the system should handle them gracefully
  And URL parsing should not fail on valid edge cases
  And appropriate errors should be shown for invalid cases
  And no security vulnerabilities should be introduced
```

### Test Case 10.9: Resource Cleanup and Lifecycle Management
```gherkin
Scenario: System properly cleans up resources during navigation
  Given various navigation scenarios:
    | navigation_type        | resources_to_cleanup                    |
    | leave_conversation     | Context files, event listeners         |
    | browser_refresh        | Pending requests, cached data           |
    | tab_close             | All resources, network requests         |
    | error_redirect        | Partial loads, failed requests          |
  When each navigation occurs
  Then all resources should be properly cleaned up
  And no memory leaks should occur
  And network requests should be cancelled appropriately
  And event listeners should be removed
  And cached data should be managed efficiently
```

### Test Case 10.10: Stress Testing and Breaking Points
```gherkin
Scenario: System behavior at performance limits
  Given extreme scenarios designed to test limits:
    | stress_scenario           | parameters                        | expected_behavior              |
    | massive_repository        | 10,000+ files                    | Graceful degradation           |
    | huge_conversation         | 50MB+ file                       | Show appropriate warnings      |
    | rapid_fire_requests       | 100 requests in 10 seconds      | Rate limiting, queue management |
    | memory_pressure           | Load until browser memory limit  | Graceful failure, not crash    |
  When these stress scenarios are executed
  Then the system should degrade gracefully rather than crash
  And appropriate warnings should be shown to users
  And the application should remain recoverable
  And no data corruption should occur
  And error messages should guide users to reasonable alternatives
```

### Test Case 10.11: Mobile Device Performance
```gherkin
Scenario: System performs acceptably on mobile devices
  Given mobile device constraints:
    | device_type | cpu_power | memory | network    | expected_performance |
    | high_end    | fast      | 8GB    | 4G/WiFi    | near desktop         |
    | mid_range   | medium    | 4GB    | 4G         | acceptable           |
    | low_end     | slow      | 2GB    | 3G         | basic functionality  |
  When GitHub repository loading is tested on each device type
  Then performance should be appropriate for device capabilities
  And the interface should remain usable on all devices
  And loading times should be reasonable for the network connection
  And memory usage should not cause device issues
  And the application should not crash on resource-constrained devices
```

### Test Case 10.12: Long-Running Session Stability
```gherkin
Scenario: System remains stable during extended usage sessions
  Given a long-running usage session:
    | session_duration | activities                                    |
    | 2+ hours        | Load 50+ conversations, navigate extensively |
  When the session continues for extended periods
  Then the application should remain responsive
  And memory usage should not grow unbounded
  And no performance degradation should occur over time
  And all functionality should continue to work correctly
  And no accumulated errors should affect user experience
