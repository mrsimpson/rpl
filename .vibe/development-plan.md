# Development Plan: rpl (main branch)

*Generated on 2025-06-30 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: epcc*

## Goal
Add a hackathon badge component to the LLM Conversation Replay Player, similar to the one in seal.codes project. The badge should be a folded corner design with a circular badge image.

## Explore
### Tasks
- [x] Examine existing HackathonBadge component from seal.codes
- [x] Understand the design and functionality requirements
- [x] Identify integration points in the RPL application
- [x] Determine badge image and styling needs

### Findings
**Existing HackathonBadge Analysis:**
- Uses folded corner triangle design with CSS borders
- Positioned as fixed overlay (top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left)
- Contains circular badge image with hover effects
- Responsive design with mobile-specific styling
- Links to hackathon page (/hackathon)
- Uses white_circle_360x360.png badge image

**RPL Integration Requirements:**
- Need to add HackathonBadge component to main App.vue
- Should position in top-right corner (default)
- Need badge image asset (white_circle_360x360.png or similar)
- Link should point to appropriate hackathon page/info
- Should not interfere with existing terminal interface

**Asset Requirements:**
- Badge image: circular design, 360x360px recommended
- Should be white/light colored for visibility on dark backgrounds
- Could use existing hackathon logo or create RPL-specific badge

**Integration Points:**
- Add component import to App.vue
- Place badge component in template
- Ensure z-index doesn't conflict with terminal interface
- Consider mobile responsiveness with existing responsive design

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyzed existing HackathonBadge component structure
- [x] Identified integration points in App.vue
- [x] Located badge image asset in seal.codes project
- [x] Determined positioning and styling requirements

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Badge design and functionality requirements understood
- [x] Integration approach determined
- [x] Asset requirements identified

### Tasks
- [x] Create detailed implementation strategy
- [x] Define component structure and props
- [x] Plan asset copying and integration
- [x] Determine positioning and styling approach
- [x] Plan App.vue integration

### Implementation Strategy

**Step 1: Asset Preparation**
- Copy badge image from seal.codes to RPL public folder
- Use existing white_circle_360x360.png or create RPL-specific badge
- Ensure image is optimized for web use

**Step 2: Component Creation**
- Create src/components/HackathonBadge.vue
- Adapt existing component structure for RPL context
- Maintain responsive design and hover effects
- Configure default position as top-right

**Step 3: Integration**
- Import HackathonBadge in App.vue
- Add component to template with appropriate positioning
- Ensure z-index doesn't conflict with terminal interface
- Test on both desktop and mobile

**Step 4: Configuration**
- Set appropriate link destination (GitHub repo or hackathon info)
- Configure badge title and alt text for RPL context
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Design Decisions
- **Position**: Top-right corner (default from original)
- **Link Target**: GitHub repository or hackathon information
- **Badge Image**: Reuse white_circle_360x360.png for consistency
- **Styling**: Maintain original folded corner design
- **Responsiveness**: Keep mobile-first responsive behavior

### Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive implementation plan

## Code

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Implementation plan is complete and detailed
- [x] All dependencies and assets identified
- [x] Integration approach finalized

### Tasks
- [x] Copy badge image asset to public folder
- [x] Create HackathonBadge.vue component
- [x] Adapt component styling for RPL context
- [x] Configure component props and positioning
- [x] Import and integrate badge in App.vue
- [x] Test positioning and responsiveness
- [x] Verify no conflicts with existing UI
- [x] Test hover effects and interactions

### Implementation Details
**Component Structure:**
- TypeScript setup with position prop
- Computed properties for positioning classes
- Folded corner triangle with CSS borders
- Circular badge image with hover effects
- Responsive mobile styling

**Integration Points:**
- App.vue template after main content
- Z-index coordination with terminal interface
- Link configuration for RPL context

### Completed
- [x] Badge image copied to public folder
- [x] HackathonBadge component created and styled
- [x] Component integrated into App.vue
- [x] Build successful with all assets included
- [x] Development server working with badge visible

## Commit

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Badge component implemented and working
- [x] Integration complete in main application
- [x] No regressions in existing functionality

### Tasks
- [x] Review code quality and structure
- [x] Verify build includes all assets
- [x] Test development and production builds
- [x] Confirm responsive design works
- [x] Validate accessibility and hover effects
- [x] Prepare comprehensive commit message
- [x] Ready for deployment

### Final Review Results
**✅ Code Quality:**
- TypeScript component with proper typing
- Clean, maintainable component structure
- Follows Vue 3 Composition API best practices
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

**✅ Build Verification:**
- Production build successful (2.42s)
- All assets included in dist folder
- Badge image properly copied and accessible
- No TypeScript errors or warnings

**✅ Functionality:**
- Badge positioned correctly in top-right corner
- Hover effects working (scale and shadow)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Link points to GitHub repository
- No conflicts with terminal interface

**✅ Integration:**
- Component properly imported in App.vue
- Z-index coordination working correctly
- No impact on existing functionality
- Development server working perfectly

### Completed
- [x] All finalization tasks completed
- [x] Feature ready for commit and deployment

## Key Decisions
- **Reuse existing design**: Maintain folded corner design from seal.codes for consistency
- **Top-right positioning**: Use default position to avoid interfering with terminal controls
- **Asset reuse**: Copy white_circle_360x360.png badge image for consistency across projects
- **GitHub link**: Point badge to RPL GitHub repository for hackathon context
- **Component isolation**: Create separate component file for maintainability
