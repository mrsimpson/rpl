# Development Plan: rpl (main branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: bugfix*

## Goal
Fix URL parameter handling for conversation loading. When loading a conversation from a URL, the URL should be added as a query parameter to `/conversation?url=...` and the conversation component should read only from this route parameter.

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Examine current router setup in `/src/router/index.ts`
- [x] Analyze App.vue URL parameter handling
- [x] Check SourceInput component behavior
- [x] Test current URL parameter functionality at localhost:5173
- [x] Document current vs expected behavior
- [x] Identify the specific issue with URL parameter handling

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Found that router is configured with `/conversation` route that accepts `url` query parameter
- [x] App.vue has `conversationUrl` computed property that reads from route.query.url
- [x] App.vue has watcher that calls `loadConversationFromUrl()` when URL changes
- [x] **BUG REPRODUCED**: 
  - ✅ URL parameter detection works (shows loading state)
  - ❌ SourceInput doesn't navigate to `/conversation?url=...` when loading
  - ❌ Error handling redirects to `/` instead of staying on `/conversation`
  - ❌ Demo loads on `/` route instead of `/conversation?url=demo`

## Analyze

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Bug has been successfully reproduced
- [x] Steps to reproduce are documented
- [x] Current behavior vs expected behavior is clear

### Tasks
- [x] Analyze SourceInput component's event emission vs navigation approach
- [x] Examine the flow when user enters URL in SourceInput
- [x] Identify where URL navigation should be triggered (SourceInput vs App.vue)
- [x] Determine if demo functionality should also use URL parameters
- [x] Plan the code changes needed for proper URL parameter flow

### Completed
- [x] **Root Cause Analysis Complete**:
  - SourceInput.vue line 130: `emit('loadConversation', conversationData)` - directly emits parsed data
  - SourceInput.vue line 205: `emit('loadConversation', demoData)` - demo also emits directly  
  - File upload (line 155) also emits directly
  - **Solution**: Replace direct emission with router navigation to `/conversation?url=...`
- [x] **Code Changes Plan**:
  1. SourceInput: Import `useRouter` from vue-router
  2. SourceInput: Replace `emit('loadConversation', conversationData)` with `router.push('/conversation?url=' + encodeURIComponent(sourceUrl.value))`
  3. SourceInput: Replace demo emission with `router.push('/conversation?url=demo')`
  4. App.vue: Handle special case `url=demo` to load demo data
  5. Keep file upload as direct emission (no URL to navigate to)
- [x] **Code Changes Plan**:
  1. SourceInput: Import `useRouter` from vue-router
  2. SourceInput: Replace `emit('loadConversation', conversationData)` with `router.push('/conversation?url=' + encodeURIComponent(sourceUrl.value))`
  3. SourceInput: Replace demo emission with `router.push('/conversation?url=demo')`
  4. App.vue: Handle special case `url=demo` to load demo data
  5. Keep file upload as direct emission (no URL to navigate to)

## Fix

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Root cause has been identified
- [x] Analysis of the problematic code is complete
- [x] Fix approach has been determined

### Tasks
- [x] Modify SourceInput.vue to import useRouter
- [x] Replace URL loading emission with router navigation
- [x] Replace demo loading emission with router navigation  
- [x] Modify App.vue to handle demo URL parameter
- [x] Test the changes work correctly

### Completed
- [x] **All Fix Tasks Complete**:
  - ✅ SourceInput now uses `useRouter` and navigates to `/conversation?url=...`
  - ✅ Demo functionality navigates to `/conversation?url=demo`
  - ✅ App.vue handles special "demo" URL parameter
  - ✅ URL encoding works correctly (tested with example.com)
  - ✅ Direct URL access works (tested `/conversation?url=demo`)
  - ✅ Error handling still redirects to home as expected
  - ✅ File upload functionality preserved (still uses direct emission)

## Verify

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Fix has been implemented
- [x] Code changes are complete
- [x] Ready for testing and verification

### Tasks
- [x] Verify original bug scenarios are fixed
- [x] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [x] Confirm no regressions in existing functionality
- [x] Validate URL encoding/decoding works properly
- [x] Test file upload still works (should remain unchanged)
- [x] Document the final solution

### Completed
- [x] **All Verification Tests Passed**:
  - ✅ **Original Bug Fixed**: SourceInput now navigates to `/conversation?url=...` instead of direct emission
  - ✅ **Demo Navigation**: Demo button navigates to `/conversation?url=demo` and loads correctly
  - ✅ **URL Encoding**: Complex URLs with spaces and special characters are properly encoded
  - ✅ **Error Handling**: Failed URLs still redirect to home as expected (user-approved behavior)
  - ✅ **No Regressions**: File upload functionality preserved, all existing features work
  - ✅ **Direct URL Access**: `/conversation?url=demo` works when accessed directly
  - ✅ **Route Parameter Reading**: App.vue correctly reads and processes URL parameters

## Final Solution Summary

**Problem**: When loading conversations from URLs, the application didn't use the `/conversation?url=...` route pattern consistently.

**Root Cause**: SourceInput component emitted `loadConversation` events directly instead of navigating to the conversation route.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **SourceInput.vue**: Added `useRouter` import and replaced direct emissions with `router.push('/conversation?url=...')`
2. **App.vue**: Added special handling for `url=demo` parameter to load demo data
3. **Preserved**: File upload functionality (no URL to navigate to)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent URL structure for all conversation loading
- ✅ Shareable URLs for conversations and demos  
- ✅ Proper browser history and navigation
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality

## Key Decisions
- **Root Cause Identified**: SourceInput component emits `loadConversation` event directly instead of navigating to `/conversation?url=...`
- **Current Flow**: Home → SourceInput → Direct conversation load (stays on `/`)
- **Expected Flow**: Home → SourceInput → Navigate to `/conversation?url=...` → Load from URL parameter
- **Error Handling**: Current redirect to `/` on error is acceptable (confirmed by user)
- **Focus Area**: Fix the URL navigation flow, not the error handling
- **Demo Decision**: Demo should navigate to `/conversation?url=demo` for consistency and shareability
- **File Upload**: File uploads can stay as direct emission since they don't have URLs

## Notes
### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` (home page)
2. Enter any URL in SourceInput and click "Load Conversation" 
   - **Expected**: Navigate to `/conversation?url=<entered-url>`
   - **Actual**: Stays on `/` route, loads conversation directly
3. Navigate directly to `http://localhost:5173/conversation?url=https://invalid-url.com`
   - **Expected**: Stay on `/conversation` route, show error message
   - **Actual**: Shows loading, then redirects to `/` on error
4. Click "Load Demo" button
   - **Expected**: Navigate to `/conversation?url=demo` or similar
   - **Actual**: Stays on `/` route, loads demo directly

### Current vs Expected Behavior:
- **Current**: SourceInput emits `loadConversation` event → App.vue loads directly
- **Expected**: SourceInput navigates to `/conversation?url=...` → App.vue reads from route parameter
