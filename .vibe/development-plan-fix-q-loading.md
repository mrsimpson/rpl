# Development Plan: rpl (fix-q-loading branch)

*Generated on 2025-08-14 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [c4-analysis](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/c4-analysis)*

## Goal
Fix bug where UI cannot load conversation from GitHub URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrsimpson/demo-responsible-vibe-kniffel-cli/refs/heads/main/.vibe/making-of-greenfield.json

The issue appears to be a format mismatch between the expected Q-Developer JSON structure and the actual structure in the file.

## Discovery
### Tasks
- [x] Examine the failing conversation file structure
- [x] Analyze current JSON parser logic
- [x] Identify specific parsing issues
- [x] Test current parser with the problematic file
- [x] Document the new format structure
- [x] Create fix for the parser
- [x] Test the fix in the browser application

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Retrieved sample of the problematic JSON file
- [x] Examined current JsonFormatParser.ts implementation
- [x] Confirmed the parsing issue with test script
- [x] Updated parseQDeveloperFormat method to handle both array and object formats
- [x] Successfully tested the fix - conversation now loads with 332 messages

## Context Analysis
### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Container Analysis
### Tasks
- [x] Refactor JSON parser to use version-based parser selection
- [x] Create separate parser classes for different Q-Developer format versions
- [x] Implement format version detection logic
- [x] Update main JsonFormatParser to use the new architecture
- [x] Test the refactored solution
- [ ] Create documentation for the new parser architecture

### Completed
- [x] Created QDeveloperFormatDetector for version detection
- [x] Created QDeveloperVersionParser interface and base class
- [x] Implemented QDeveloperV1Parser for legacy array format
- [x] Implemented QDeveloperV2Parser for new object format
- [x] Created QDeveloperParserFactory for parser management
- [x] Refactored JsonFormatParser to use the new system
- [x] Successfully tested with the problematic conversation file

## Key Decisions
- **REFACTORED**: Replaced if-statement approach with elegant version-based parser system
- **Architecture**: Created separate parser classes for each Q-Developer format version
- **Extensibility**: New format versions can be easily added by implementing QDeveloperVersionParser interface
- **Factory Pattern**: QDeveloperParserFactory manages parser selection and instantiation
- **Detection Logic**: QDeveloperFormatDetector automatically identifies format versions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Both V1 (array) and V2 (object) formats supported seamlessly

## Notes
**New Architecture Benefits:**
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Each parser handles one specific format version
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new format versions without modifying existing code
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear, focused classes instead of complex if-statement chains
- ✅ **Testability**: Each parser can be tested independently
- ✅ **Factory Pattern**: Centralized parser management and selection

**File Structure:**
```
src/parsers/
├── JsonFormatParser.ts              # Main entry point, delegates to version parsers
├── QDeveloperFormatDetector.ts      # Version detection logic
├── QDeveloperVersionParser.ts       # Parser interface and implementations
└── QDeveloperParserFactory.ts       # Parser factory and management
```

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
// Automatic version detection and parsing
const result = QDeveloperParserFactory.parse(jsonData)

// Manual version analysis
const analysis = QDeveloperParserFactory.analyzeFormat(jsonData)
console.log(`Detected version: ${analysis.version}`)
```

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ V2 format correctly detected and parsed (332 messages)
- ✅ All playback functionality working perfectly
- ✅ Clean separation between format detection and parsing logic
- ✅ Easy to extend for future format versions
