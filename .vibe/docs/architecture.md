# System Architecture Documentation (C4 Model)

*This document follows the C4 model for software architecture documentation, focusing on Context, Container, and Component levels.*

## 1. System Context (C4 Level 1)

### System Overview
The LLM Conversation Replay Player is a Vue.js single-page application that provides an interactive terminal-style interface for replaying and analyzing LLM conversations. It supports multiple conversation sources and formats, featuring typewriter animations, keyboard controls, and context visualization.

### Users and Personas
- **Development Teams**: Software developers reviewing and analyzing LLM conversations for debugging, improvement, and understanding conversation patterns
- **AI Researchers**: Academic and industry researchers studying LLM behavior, conversation flows, and interaction patterns for research purposes
- **Content Creators**: Technical writers and educators creating interactive conversation demonstrations and examples for documentation or training
- **QA Engineers**: Quality assurance professionals testing and validating LLM application conversation flows and identifying issues

### External Systems
- **GitHub Gist API**: REST API (`https://api.github.com/gists/{gistId}`) for loading conversations and context files from public GitHub Gists
- **GitHub Repository API**: REST API (`https://api.github.com/repos/{user}/{repo}/contents/{path}`) for loading conversations from GitHub repositories
- **File System Access API**: Browser API enabling secure access to user's local files and folders for conversation loading
- **Web URLs**: Generic HTTP/HTTPS endpoints for loading conversations from any accessible web location
- **Browser APIs**: localStorage for settings persistence, browser history for navigation

### System Boundaries
- **Inside the system**: Vue.js SPA with conversation parsing and display, source adapters, format parsers, terminal UI with animations, settings and theme management, context visualization
- **Outside the system**: GitHub API services, user's local file system, external web servers, browser environment, operating system

### Context Diagram
The system sits at the center, interfacing with multiple external conversation sources (GitHub Gist, GitHub Repos, Local Files, Web URLs) and serving different user types through a web browser interface.

## 2. Container Architecture (C4 Level 2)

### Container Overview
The system consists of three main containers: a client-side Vue.js SPA, a static asset container, and a background context prefetching service. This architecture follows a modern single-page application pattern with client-side rendering and external API integration.

#### Vue.js SPA Container
- **Technology**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API, TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - User interface rendering and interaction handling
  - Conversation loading and parsing from multiple sources
  - Terminal-style conversation replay with animations
  - Settings management and theme system
  - Context visualization and management
- **Interfaces**: 
  - Web browser DOM APIs
  - GitHub REST APIs (Gist and Repository)
  - File System Access API for local files
  - Browser localStorage for persistence
- **Data Storage**: 
  - Browser localStorage for user settings and preferences
  - In-memory reactive state for conversation data
  - Browser cache for static assets and API responses

#### Static Asset Container
- **Technology**: Static file serving (Netlify/CDN optimized)
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Serving compiled JavaScript and CSS bundles
  - Providing static assets (icons, images, fonts)
  - SPA routing fallback configuration
- **Interfaces**: Standard HTTP requests from browsers
- **Data Storage**: File system on web server or CDN edge locations

#### Context Prefetcher Service
- **Technology**: TypeScript service class with queue-based processing
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Background prefetching of context items (images, videos, documents)
  - Intelligent caching with priority-based loading
  - Concurrent download management with rate limiting
- **Interfaces**: Internal service API, HTTP requests for context loading
- **Data Storage**: In-memory Map-based cache, loading promise management

### Container Interactions
- **Vue.js SPA ↔ GitHub APIs**: RESTful HTTP communication for conversation and repository data
- **Vue.js SPA ↔ File System Access API**: Browser API integration for secure local file access
- **Vue.js SPA → Static Asset Container**: HTTP requests for application assets and resources
- **Vue.js SPA ↔ Context Prefetcher Service**: Internal service communication for background loading
- **Context Prefetcher Service → External URLs**: HTTP requests for context item prefetching
- **Vue.js SPA ↔ Browser localStorage**: Direct API calls for settings persistence and retrieval

### Deployment Architecture
- **Environment**: Client-side deployment to static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or similar CDN)
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Static file hosting with global CDN distribution
  - SPA routing configuration with fallback to index.html
  - No server-side components or databases required
- **Scaling**: 
  - Horizontal scaling through CDN edge locations
  - Client-side processing reduces server load
  - Caching strategies for external API responses

### Container Diagram
The Vue.js SPA sits at the center, communicating with external APIs, the browser environment, and internal services. Static assets are served separately through CDN infrastructure, while the Context Prefetcher Service operates as an internal background service within the SPA container.

## 3. Architecture Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Decision 1: Single-Page Application Architecture
- **Context**: Need for interactive conversation replay with real-time user controls
- **Decision**: Vue.js 3 SPA with client-side routing and state management
- **Rationale**: Provides responsive user experience, eliminates server-side complexity, enables rich interactions
- **Consequences**: Requires client-side state management, depends on browser capabilities, simplified deployment

#### Decision 2: Adapter Pattern for Multiple Sources
- **Context**: Support for different conversation sources (GitHub, local files, web URLs)
- **Decision**: Implement adapter pattern with unified SourceAdapter interface
- **Rationale**: Enables extensibility, maintains clean separation of concerns, simplifies adding new sources
- **Consequences**: Slightly more complex architecture, but highly maintainable and extensible

#### Decision 3: Browser-First Storage Strategy
- **Context**: Need for settings persistence without server-side database
- **Decision**: Use localStorage for settings, in-memory state for conversations
- **Rationale**: Eliminates server infrastructure, provides instant access, respects user privacy
- **Consequences**: Settings are device-specific, no cross-device synchronization

### Technology Choices
- **Vue.js 3**: Modern reactive framework with excellent TypeScript support and Composition API
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, better developer experience, and improved maintainability
- **Vite**: Fast development server, optimized production builds, modern tooling
- **File System Access API**: Secure local file access with proper user consent

## 4. Quality Attributes

### Performance Characteristics
- **Response Times**: Sub-100ms UI interactions, lazy loading for large conversations
- **Throughput**: Client-side processing eliminates server bottlenecks
- **Scalability**: CDN-based deployment scales globally with edge distribution

### Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: No authentication required - client-side only application
- **Authorization**: File System Access API provides secure, user-consented file access
- **Data Protection**: No sensitive data stored server-side, localStorage for preferences only

### Reliability and Availability
- **Uptime Requirements**: 99.9% availability through CDN infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures, network issues, and invalid data
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation, retry logic for failed requests

## 5. Enhancement Recommendations

### Modernization Opportunities
