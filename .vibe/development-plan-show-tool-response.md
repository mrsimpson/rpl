# Development Plan: rpl (show-tool-response branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-10 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: minor*

## Goal
Add visualization of tool call responses in Q JSON format. Tool calls have IDs that are referenced in subsequent tool_use_results. Show these responses on request (hidden by default) to provide complete interaction flow visibility.

## Explore
### Phase Entrance Criteria
*Initial phase - no entrance criteria*

### Tasks
- [x] Define content vs structured response handling rules

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Analyze current Q JSON parsing structure
- [x] Understand tool_use and tool_use_results relationship
- [x] Design UI/UX for showing tool responses (hidden by default)
- [x] Identify where to store tool response mappings

## Implement
### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Tool call/response relationship is clearly understood
- [x] UI design approach is defined (expandable/collapsible interface)
- [x] Data structure for mapping tool calls to responses is planned
- [x] Integration points with existing components are identified

### Tasks
- [x] Create tool response mapping logic in ConversationDisplay component
- [x] Modify ToolCallRenderer to accept and display linked responses
- [x] Add expandable UI for tool responses (hidden by default)
- [x] Implement content vs structured response detection
- [x] Hide standalone tool_result messages when linked to tool_use
- [x] Add toggle functionality for showing/hiding responses
- [x] Test with sample Q JSON data
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing tool displays
- [x] Fix JSON parser to correctly handle Q-Developer format tool results structure
- [x] Verify tool response mapping works correctly with real conversation data
- [x] Fix tool responses showing by default (ensure they're hidden in expandable sections)
- [x] Fix playback breaking issue by correcting message filtering approach
- [x] Test playback continuity beyond message 10 (verified working to message 22+)
- [x] Comprehensive testing with real Q-Developer conversation data (66 messages)
- [x] Verify expandable/collapsible functionality works correctly
- [x] Confirm tool response button positioning and styling
- [x] Test multiple tool types (file operations, MCP tools, etc.)

- [x] Verify expandable/collapsible functionality works correctly across different tool types
- [x] Confirm proper UI positioning and styling of response buttons in tool headers

## Key Decisions
- **Tool Call/Response Relationship**: Tool calls have `id` field, responses have `tool_use_id` that references the call
- **Current Structure**: JsonFormatParser already creates separate messages for tool_use and tool_result with metadata containing toolId
- **Integration Point**: ToolCallRenderer component handles tool call display, MessageRenderer orchestrates overall message display
- **Data Flow**: Parser → Message objects with metadata → ToolCallRenderer for display
- **UI Design**: Add expandable section to tool_use displays with "Show Response" button, collapse tool_result messages by default
- **Data Mapping**: Create tool response map in ConversationDisplay component to link tool calls to their results
- **Content vs Structured Response**: Tool responses with "content" fields should be displayed as regular agent messages, not as tool results. Only purely structured responses should be shown as expandable tool result sections.
- **Q-Developer Format Structure**: Tool results are in separate history entries, not in the same entry as tool uses. Parser needed to be updated to handle this structure correctly.
- **Tool Response Mapping**: Successfully implemented using computed property that maps tool_use_id to tool_result messages, enabling proper linking of calls to responses.

## Notes
### Current Q JSON Structure Analysis
- Tool calls are parsed into separate messages with type 'tool_call'
- Tool use messages have metadata: `{ toolName, toolId, toolType: 'use' }`
- Tool result messages have metadata: `{ toolId, toolType: 'result', status }`
- ToolCallRenderer already handles different tool types (tool_use, tool_result, tool_cancelled)

### Technical Findings
- JsonFormatParser.ts already extracts tool IDs and creates proper message relationships
- ToolCallRenderer.vue displays tool calls with different styling per type
- MessageRenderer.vue orchestrates the display and handles tool_call type messages
- Messages are processed sequentially, so tool results appear after their corresponding calls

### Content vs Structured Response Rules
- **Agent Message Display**: If tool_use_results contains `content` field with readable text, display as regular agent message
- **Structured Response Display**: If tool_use_results contains only structured data (JSON, status codes, etc.), show as expandable tool result
- **Hybrid Handling**: Tool calls can have both content (shown as agent message) and structured data (shown in expandable section)
- **Detection Logic**: Check for `content[0].Text` or similar readable content patterns to determine display type
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing tool result messages should still work as before when not linked to tool calls

### Testing Results Summary
**Comprehensive Testing Completed**: Successfully tested the tool response visualization feature with real Q-Developer conversation data (66 messages total).

**Key Test Results**:
- ✅ **Expandable Functionality**: Tool responses properly hidden by default, expandable on demand
- ✅ **UI Positioning**: Response buttons correctly positioned in tool headers with proper styling
- ✅ **Multiple Tool Types**: Tested with file operations (fs_read, fs_write) and MCP tools (responsible_vibe_mcp)
- ✅ **Toggle Functionality**: Expand/collapse works correctly (▶ ↔ ▼ button states)
- ✅ **Playback Continuity**: Conversation playback continues properly beyond tool calls (tested to message 24+)
- ✅ **JSON Format Support**: Q-Developer format tool results properly parsed and linked
- ✅ **Content Display**: Complex tool responses (file contents, JSON structures) display correctly
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing conversation formats continue to work without issues

**Test Environment**: Real conversation data from slides development project with multiple tool interactions including file operations, development workflow tools, and structured JSON responses.
