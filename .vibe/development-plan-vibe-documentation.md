- [x] Update design documentation with external interface details

### Completed
- [x] Identified four main external systems: GitHub Gist API, GitHub Repository API, File System Access API, and Web URLs
- [x] Mapped four user personas: Development Teams, AI Researchers, Content Creators, and QA Engineers
- [x] Documented external dependencies and their communication patterns
- [x] Defined clear system boundaries between internal Vue.js SPA and external services
- [x] Enhanced architecture.md with comprehensive context analysis
- [x] Updated design.md with external interface implementation details

## Container Analysis

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] System boundaries have been clearly defined
- [x] External systems and dependencies have been identified
- [x] User types and personas have been documented

### Tasks
- [x] Identify main application containers (web app, API, services)
- [x] Map databases and data stores
- [x] Understand deployment architecture
- [x] Document communication patterns between containers
- [x] Enhance architecture documentation with C4 Level 2 (Container) findings
- [x] Update design documentation with container interaction details
- [x] Update DISCOVERY.md with container analysis findings

### Completed
- [x] Identified three main containers: Vue.js SPA, Static Asset Container, and Context Prefetcher Service
- [x] Documented data storage patterns: localStorage for settings, in-memory for state, browser cache for assets
- [x] Analyzed deployment architecture: Static hosting with CDN, SPA routing configuration
- [x] Mapped container communication patterns and interfaces
- [x] Enhanced architecture.md with comprehensive container analysis
- [x] Updated design.md with container interaction design patterns
- [x] Updated DISCOVERY.md with detailed container findings

### Completed
*None yet*

## Component Analysis

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [x] Major containers and services have been identified
- [x] Container communication patterns have been documented
- [x] Deployment architecture has been understood
- [x] Container-level architecture has been documented
- [x] Component candidates have been identified for detailed analysis

### Tasks
- [ ] Analyze ConversationDisplay.vue component (main terminal interface)
- [ ] Analyze SourceInput.vue component (conversation loading)
- [ ] Analyze useConversationState composable (state management)
- [ ] Analyze adapter system components (FileSourceAdapter, GistSourceAdapter, etc.)
- [ ] Analyze parser system components (TextFormatParser, JsonFormatParser)
- [ ] Analyze context management components (ContextViewer, ContextPanel)
- [ ] Analyze theme and settings components (SettingsPanel, useTheme)
- [ ] Document component-level design patterns and responsibilities
- [ ] Enhance architecture documentation with C4 Level 3 (Component) details
- [ ] Update design documentation with detailed component analysis

### Completed
*None yet*

## Documentation Consolidation

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Selected components have been analyzed in detail
- [ ] Component responsibilities and interfaces have been documented
- [ ] Component-level design patterns have been identified
- [ ] Technical debt and improvement opportunities have been noted
- [ ] All C4 levels (Context, Container, Component) have been analyzed

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed
*None yet*

## Analysis Complete

### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Architecture documentation has been finalized and polished
- [ ] Design documentation has been completed
- [ ] Enhancement recommendations have been prepared
- [ ] API testing strategy has been documented
- [ ] Modernization roadmap has been created

## Key Decisions
- **C4 Analysis Approach**: Using progressive analysis from Context â†’ Container levels (Component level deferred)
- **Documentation Strategy**: Created DISCOVERY.md as long-term memory, enhanced existing architecture.md and design.md
- **Scope Management**: Focus on core application architecture, sufficient detail for current needs
- **Technology Assessment**: Confirmed modern Vue.js 3 + TypeScript stack with excellent existing documentation
- **Finalization Focus**: Vue component principles documented, placeholders cleaned up, README enhanced with architectural insights

## Notes
- **Project Quality**: Exceptionally well-documented and structured Vue.js application
- **Architecture Maturity**: Clean separation of concerns with adapter patterns and composables
- **Technology Stack**: Modern Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite with comprehensive testing setup
- **Development Readiness**: Project appears ready for enhancements with solid foundation
- **Documentation Assets**: README.md enhanced with architectural insights, comprehensive architecture.md and design.md created
- **C4 Analysis Complete**: Context and Container levels analyzed, Component level deferred per user request
- **Documentation Finalized**: Vue component principles documented, placeholders removed, README enhanced
