# Development Plan: rpl (fix-mobile branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-06 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: bugfix*

## Goal
Fix mobile context interaction issues in the LLM Conversation Replay Player Vue.js application. 

**Specific Problem**: On mobile devices, users cannot properly interact with context panels. The context should slide up from the bottom as a full-width overlay when context changes, allow users to minimize it, and stay minimized until the next context change occurs.

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Examine current mobile responsive design implementation
- [x] Load the example conversation with context (minor-context-improvements)
- [x] Test context interaction on mobile viewport (375px width)
- [x] Document current context panel behavior on mobile
- [x] Identify specific issues with context accessibility on mobile
- [ ] Test context panel visibility and interaction on small screens
- [ ] Document expected vs actual behavior for context sliding/minimizing
- [ ] Test touch interactions with context elements

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Defined project goal and initial reproduction tasks
- [x] Identified specific mobile context interaction problem
- [x] Analyzed current ContextPanel and ConversationView implementation
- [x] Found the root cause of mobile context issues

## Verify
### Phase Entrance Criteria:
- [ ] Bug fix has been implemented
- [ ] Changes address the identified root cause
- [ ] Fix is targeted and doesn't break existing functionality
- [ ] Implementation approach is documented

### Tasks
- [ ] *To be added when this phase becomes active*

### Completed

## Key Decisions
**Root Cause Identified**: The current mobile context implementation has several issues:

1. **Context Panel Positioning**: The mobile context panel uses `position: fixed` with margins, making it appear as a modal overlay rather than sliding from bottom
2. **No Slide Animation**: The current animation slides from right (`translateX(100%)`) instead of from bottom (`translateY(100%)`) 
3. **No Minimize State**: There's no mechanism to minimize the context panel and keep it minimized until next context change
4. **Mobile Detection**: Uses `window.innerWidth < 1024` which may not be optimal for mobile context behavior
5. **Context Triggering**: No automatic context panel showing when context changes on mobile

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Context should slide up from bottom as full-width overlay
- User should be able to minimize it 
- Should stay minimized until next context change
- Should cover main window with full width when expanded
