# Development Plan: rpl (fix-mobile branch)

*Generated on 2025-07-06 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: bugfix*

## Goal
Fix mobile context interaction issues in the LLM Conversation Replay Player Vue.js application. 

**Specific Problem**: On mobile devices, users cannot properly interact with context panels. The context should slide up from the bottom as a full-width overlay when context changes, allow users to minimize it, and stay minimized until the next context change occurs.

## Reproduce
### Tasks
- [x] Examine current mobile responsive design implementation
- [x] Load the example conversation with context (minor-context-improvements)
- [x] Test context interaction on mobile viewport (375px width)
- [x] Document current context panel behavior on mobile
- [x] Identify specific issues with context accessibility on mobile
- [x] Test context panel visibility and interaction on small screens
- [x] Document expected vs actual behavior for context sliding/minimizing
- [x] Test touch interactions with context elements
- [x] Create test cases demonstrating the mobile context issues

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Defined project goal and initial reproduction tasks
- [x] Identified specific mobile context interaction problem
- [x] Analyzed current ContextPanel and ConversationView implementation
- [x] Found the root cause of mobile context issues

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the application on mobile viewport (375px width)
2. Load any conversation with context items (e.g., minor-context-improvements example)
3. Navigate through messages that have context
4. Observe that context panel is not easily accessible on mobile
5. Try to interact with context - panel appears as fixed modal instead of sliding from bottom
6. No way to minimize context panel and keep it minimized until next context change

### Test Cases:
- **TC1**: Context panel should slide from bottom on mobile when context changes
- **TC2**: Context panel should be full-width on mobile

## Final Summary ✅
**All Issues Resolved Successfully:**

1. **Mobile Context Panel**: Fixed sliding from bottom, minimize functionality, auto-show behavior
2. **Context Panel Close**: Resolved scrolling interference issue
3. **Play Button Styling**: Added green coloring with proper contrast for light/dark themes

**Commit**: `37655a5` - feat: Add green styling to play button for better identification

**Status**: All requested fixes implemented and tested successfully.

## Key Decisions
**Root Cause Identified**: The current mobile context implementation has several issues:

1. **Context Panel Positioning**: The mobile context panel uses `position: fixed` with margins, making it appear as a modal overlay rather than sliding from bottom
2. **No Slide Animation**: The current animation slides from right (`translateX(100%)`) instead of from bottom (`translateY(100%)`) 
3. **No Minimize State**: There's no mechanism to minimize the context panel and keep it minimized until next context change
4. **Mobile Detection**: Uses `window.innerWidth < 1024` which may not be optimal for mobile context behavior
5. **Context Triggering**: No automatic context panel showing when context changes on mobile

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Context should slide up from bottom as full-width overlay
- User should be able to minimize it 
- Should stay minimized until next context change
- Should cover main window with full width when expanded

## Notes
### Current Architecture Analysis:

**ContextPanel Component Issues:**
1. **Animation Direction**: Uses `translateX(100%)` for slide animation - should be `translateY(100%)` for mobile
2. **Positioning**: Uses `position: fixed` with margins - should use bottom positioning for slide-up effect
3. **State Management**: No minimize/maximize state - needs new state variables
4. **Mobile Detection**: Uses `isMobile` prop but doesn't differentiate behavior enough
5. **Auto-show Logic**: No automatic showing when context changes - needs context change detection

**ConversationView Component Issues:**
1. **Context Triggering**: `handleMessageHasContext` doesn't auto-show context panel on mobile
2. **Mobile Layout**: Uses media queries but doesn't handle mobile context panel behavior
3. **State Management**: No minimize state persistence across context changes

### Mobile Context Panel Behavior Design:

**States:**
1. **Hidden**: Context panel not visible (default state)
2. **Expanded**: Context panel slides up from bottom, covers full width
3. **Minimized**: Context panel shows as small bar at bottom with minimize indicator

**Behavior Flow:**
1. When context changes → Auto-show in Expanded state (unless previously minimized for this context)
2. User can minimize → Transition to Minimized state
3. User can expand from minimized → Transition to Expanded state  
4. When new context changes → Reset to Expanded state (ignore previous minimize)
5. User can close → Transition to Hidden state

### Slide Animation Implementation Plan:

**CSS Transitions:**
```css
/* Mobile slide-up animation */
.context-slide-mobile-enter-active,
.context-slide-mobile-leave-active {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out;
}

.context-slide-mobile-enter-from {
  transform: translateY(100%); /* Start from bottom */
}

.context-slide-mobile-leave-to {
  transform: translateY(100%); /* Exit to bottom */
}

/* Minimize animation */
.context-minimize-enter-active,
.context-minimize-leave-active {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-out, height 0.2s ease-out;
}
```

### State Management Design:

**New State Variables:**
```typescript
// In ContextPanel component
const contextState = ref<'hidden' | 'expanded' | 'minimized'>('hidden')
const lastContextId = ref<string | null>(null)
const contextChangeId = computed(() => 
  contextItems.value.map(item => item.id).join('-')
)

// In ConversationView/useConversationState
const mobileContextState = ref<'hidden' | 'expanded' | 'minimized'>('hidden')
```

**State Transitions:**
1. **Context Change Detection**: 
   - Compare `contextChangeId` with `lastContextId`
   - If different → new context → reset to 'expanded' (if has context)
   - Update `lastContextId`

2. **User Actions**:
   - Minimize button → 'expanded' to 'minimized'
   - Expand tap → 'minimized' to 'expanded'  
   - Close button → any state to 'hidden'

### Context Change Detection & Auto-show Logic:

**Detection Strategy:**
```typescript
// Watch for context changes
watch(
  () => currentMessageContext.value,
  (newContext, oldContext) => {
    if (isMobile.value && newContext.length > 0) {
      const newContextId = newContext.map(item => item.id).join('-')
      const oldContextId = oldContext?.map(item => item.id).join('-') || ''
      
      if (newContextId !== oldContextId) {
        // New context detected - auto-show as expanded
        mobileContextState.value = 'expanded'
        lastContextId.value = newContextId
      }
    } else if (newContext.length === 0) {
      // No context - hide panel
      mobileContextState.value = 'hidden'
    }
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```

### Responsive Breakpoints Analysis:

**Current Implementation:**
- ConversationView: `window.innerWidth < 1024` for mobile detection
- AppFooter: `@media (max-width: 768px)` for mobile styles
- SourceInput: `@media (max-width: 768px)` for mobile styles

**Recommended Approach:**
```typescript
// Consistent mobile detection
const MOBILE_BREAKPOINT = 768 // Match CSS media queries
const isMobile = computed(() => window.innerWidth <= MOBILE_BREAKPOINT)

// Use composable for consistent detection
export function useResponsive() {
  const windowWidth = ref(window.innerWidth)
  const isMobile = computed(() => windowWidth.value <= 768)
  const isTablet = computed(() => windowWidth.value > 768 && windowWidth.value <= 1024)
  const isDesktop = computed(() => windowWidth.value > 1024)
  
  return { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop }
}
```

### Full-Width Mobile Overlay Design:

**Layout Structure:**
```css
/* Mobile context panel positioning */
.context-panel--mobile {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 1000;
  max-height: 70vh; /* Don't cover entire screen */
  border-radius: 12px 12px 0 0; /* Rounded top corners */
}

/* Expanded state */
.context-panel--mobile.expanded {
  height: 70vh;
}

/* Minimized state */
.context-panel--mobile.minimized {
  height: 60px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* Backdrop overlay */
.context-backdrop {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  z-index: 999;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
}

.context-backdrop.visible {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Solution Architecture Summary:

**Components to Modify:**
1. **ContextPanel.vue**: Add mobile states, animations, and minimize functionality
2. **ConversationView.vue**: Add context change detection and auto-show logic
3. **useConversationState.ts**: Add mobile context state management
4. **New composable**: `useResponsive.ts` for consistent breakpoint detection

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1**: Add mobile state management and responsive detection
2. **Phase 2**: Implement bottom slide animations and full-width overlay
3. **Phase 3**: Add minimize functionality and context change detection
4. **Phase 4**: Add backdrop, swipe gestures, and polish

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Desktop behavior unchanged
- Tablet behavior unchanged  
- Only mobile (≤768px) gets new behavior
- All existing props and events preserved

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test on mobile viewport (375px, 414px widths)
- Test context changes and auto-show behavior
- Test minimize/expand functionality
- Test backdrop and touch interactions
- Verify desktop functionality unchanged
