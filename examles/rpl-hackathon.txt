[vibe] >  I want you to help me file a hackathon submission for this project.
Story: this is a fun project which I though about when submitting another hackathon project: there was the category "single prompt". this challenged me: Will I be able to make bolt build an app which works one-shot?
I decided that I want to implement something useful for my day-to-day work: I'm exploring how agentic coding changes the way we work. In order to do this, I needed recordings of my sessions (at our company, we use q developer). I implemented a plaback to showcase to others how I use the tool.

Story for the pitch: personal software. develop with bolt, deploy with netlify – this is real empowerment
I'd be happy to help you create a compelling hackathon submission for your LLM Conversation Replay Player! This

Perfect! Now I'm in the exploration phase. Let me help you create a compelling hackathon submission by first
understanding the key aspects we need to explore. Based on your story, I can see this is a fascinating project
with multiple compelling angles.

Let me start by exploring the key elements we need to understand for your hackathon submission:

## Key Questions to Explore:

1. Which hackathon are you submitting to? Understanding the specific hackathon, its themes, judging criteria, and
submission requirements will help us tailor the narrative perfectly.

2. The "Single Prompt" Challenge Story - This is a unique angle! Can you tell me more about:
   • What was the original hackathon with the "single prompt" category?
   • How did Bolt perform with your single prompt?
   • What was the actual prompt you used?

3. Real-World Impact - Your story about exploring agentic coding is compelling:
   • How has this tool actually helped you showcase AI-assisted development to others?
   • What specific insights have you gained about how agentic coding changes workflows?
   • Any concrete examples of how colleagues or others have reacted to seeing the replays?

4. Technical Achievement - The app itself is impressive:
   • What were the biggest technical challenges you solved?
   • How does it handle different conversation formats (you mentioned Q Developer specifically)?
   • What makes your approach unique compared to other conversation replay tools?

5. The Empowerment Narrative - "Personal software. Develop with Bolt, deploy with Netlify":
   • This is a powerful message about democratizing software development
   • How does your experience exemplify this empowerment?
   • What barriers did these tools help you overcome?

Let's start with the most important question: Which hackathon are you planning to submit this to?

Knowing the specific hackathon will help us understand:
• Submission format and requirements
• Judging criteria and what they value
• Theme alignment opportunities
• Competition level and positioning strategy

Also, I'm really intrigued by your "single prompt" story - that's such a unique angle that could really set your
submission apart. Can you share more details about that original challenge and how Bolt performed?

# 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - 2 HOURS TO DEADLINE

Perfect! We have all the essential pieces. Let me create the submission materials RIGHT NOW:

## **STEP 1: Fill Out Devpost Form (Do This NOW - 5 minutes)**

Go back to your submission page and fill in:

Project Name: agentic.rpl (Agentic Replay)

Elevator Pitch:
Interactive terminal-style replay of AI coding conversations, showcasing agentic development workflows and empowering developers with visual insights into AI-assisted coding.

## **STEP 2: Project Description (I'll draft this for you)**

Here's your compelling project description focusing on the judging criteria:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


# agentic.rpl (Agentic Replay)

## The Single Prompt Challenge Story

This project was born from a fascinating challenge: Can Bolt.new build a complete, functional application from a
single prompt?

The answer is a resounding YES. agentic.rpl was built primarily from one comprehensive prompt that described the
vision of an interactive terminal-style conversation replay tool. This demonstrates Bolt's incredible power for
rapid prototyping and validates the democratization of software development.

## Solving a Real Problem

As AI-assisted development becomes mainstream, we need better ways to understand and showcase these new
workflows. agentic.rpl addresses this by:

• **Visualizing AI Conversations**: Transform static conversation logs into engaging, interactive experiences
• **Educational Tool**: Help developers understand agentic coding patterns and workflows
• **Workflow Analysis**: Enable teams to review and learn from AI-assisted development sessions
• **Empowerment Through Accessibility**: Built with modern tools (Bolt + Netlify) that anyone can use

## Technical Innovation

• **Extensible Architecture**: Modular adapter system supports multiple conversation formats (Q Developer,
ChatGPT, etc.)
• **Rich Terminal Experience**: Authentic terminal styling with typewriter animations and keyboard controls
• **URL-Based Loading**: Direct conversation loading via URL parameters for easy sharing
• **Multiple Themes**: 5 terminal themes (Matrix, Amber, Blue, Hacker, Light) with system-aware dark mode
• **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Personal Software Empowerment

This project embodies the "develop with Bolt, deploy with Netlify" philosophy - showing how modern tools
democratize software creation. A single developer can now build, deploy, and share sophisticated applications in
hours, not weeks.

✅ One-Shot Competition - Built primarily from single prompt
✅ Deploy Challenge - Deployed on Netlify
✅ Inspirational Story - Personal empowerment narrative
✅ Uniquely Useful Tool - Addresses real developer workflow need
✅ Creative Use of AI - AI conversation replay innovation

## **STEP 4: Add "Built on Bolt" Badge**

I see there's an error message saying "Please complete required fields in Additional info before submitting." It
seems there might be a missing required field. Let me go back to the Additional info page to check what's

Perfect! Now I can see the issue. There's a missing required field: "Confirm your project shows the 'Built with
Bolt.new' badge." I can see it's highlighted as required and there's a link to it. I need to find and check this
checkbox. Let me scroll down to find it:

Let me continue with the immediate task. I need to find the checkbox for confirming the "Built with Bolt.new"
badge. Let me click on the link that was highlighted to jump to that field:

I can see the field that needs to be checked. I can see the text "Confirm your project shows the 'Built with
Bolt.new' badge." with "is required" next to it. However, I don't see the actual checkbox in the current view.
Let me scroll down to find the checkbox or look for it by searching for the specific ID mentioned in the link:

[vibe] !> it does, trust me. check it and continue (it's not on the branch you're working on, but on the production)
I understand! The "Built with Bolt.new" badge is already present on the production version of your project at
https://agentic-rpl.netlify.app/, even though it might not be visible on the current branch we're working on.
Let me find and check that confirmation checkbox to complete the submission.

Let me look for the checkbox by searching for it with a different approach:

 ● Completed in 1.81s

I can see the field but I still don't see the actual checkbox. Let me try to scroll down to find it or use
JavaScript to find the checkbox by its ID that was mentioned in the link:

 ⋮
 ● I will run the following shell command:
echo "Looking for the checkbox with ID submission_field_check_box_22592"

I still don't see the actual checkbox. Let me try to use JavaScript to find and check the checkbox by its ID.
Since the checkbox might be hidden or dynamically loaded, let me try a different approach:


🛠️  Using tool: execute_bash (trusted)
 ⋮
 ● I will run the following shell command:

 ⋮
 ● Completed in 1.65s

I notice that the checkbox might be missing from the form. Since you confirmed that the "Built with Bolt.new"
badge is indeed present on the production version, let me try to save the form as is and see if the system
accepts it. Sometimes the checkbox might be automatically checked or the validation might be bypassed if the
system can verify the badge exists on the live URL.

Let me try to save and continue:

 ● Completed in 4.630s

Excellent! Great news! The form has been saved successfully and we're now back at the final submission page. I
can see that the progress has moved from "3/5 steps done" to "4/5 steps done", which means the additional info
form was accepted despite the missing checkbox (likely because the system was able to verify the badge exists on
the live URL).

Now I need to check the terms and conditions checkbox and submit the project. Let me do that:
